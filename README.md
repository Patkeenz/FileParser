# FileParser
 The goal of this program was to take in a .txt file and sort out different types of words and output them to their own respective files. For example, the current code will take 
 in a .txt file, and have three output files. One output file will contain all the words that had 3 or more vowels, another file will contain all the words that begin with
 the letter o, and another file will contain all the distinct words in the text. This program was written in Java on the eclipse platform.
